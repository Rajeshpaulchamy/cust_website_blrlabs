 * Any Css/Less files within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts,

 * It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear in whatever order it 
 * gets included (e.g. say you have require_tree . then the code will appear after all the directories 
 * but before any files alphabetically greater than 'application.css'
