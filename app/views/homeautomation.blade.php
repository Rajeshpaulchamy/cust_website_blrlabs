					The safety of your home and your loved ones ranks tops in life's priorities. Keep an eye on your home with home alert systems that remotely monitor and control your home, vacation property or small business. Homeowners can monitor a remote location for a plethora of environmental conditions including flooding, freezing, and carbon monoxide- to curb any potential disasters, such as pipes bursting or the complete flooding of your home.
				</p>

				<p>
					Creating a smart home involves bringing together different disciplines including entertainment, lighting, security and networking to name just a few. That’s what Smart Home Solutions does best, and our industry-leading design and documentation process simplifies it all, saving you time and money.
				</p>

				<p>
					The devices that make those decisions and actually do things are the muscles of the smart home. A motion detector might sense you stepping out of bed in the morning, but it's the automated coffee maker that reacts to that information, starting a brew that'll be ready right as you're getting out of the shower.
