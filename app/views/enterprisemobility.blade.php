				<p>
					Enterprise mobility is the trend toward a shift in work habits, with more employees working out of the office and using mobile devices and cloud services to perform business tasks.
				</p>

				<p>
					The goal of EMM is to determine if and how available mobile IT should be integrated with work processes and objectives, and how to support workers when they are using these devices in the workplace.
				</p>

				<p>
					Get closer to your customers by becoming location-independent. Help your employees work smarter and better, any time, virtually any place, whether they’re across town or across oceans. Mobile devices and applications let people work the same way they live—always connected.
				</p>

				<p>
					BLR LABS Mobile Device Management enables businesses to address challenges associated with mobility by providing a simplified, efficient way to view and manage all devices from the central admin console. Our solution enables you to enroll devices in your enterprise environment quickly, configure and update device settings over-the-air, and secure mobile devices.
