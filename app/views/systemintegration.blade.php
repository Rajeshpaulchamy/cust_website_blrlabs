					We work as a system integrator for these applications with stringent requirements in terms of processing performance, power dissipation, and flexibility. A key problem confronted by embedded system designers today is the rapid prototyping of an application-specific embedded system design where different combinations of programmable processor components, library hardware components, and customized hardware components must be integrated together, while ensuring that the hardware and software parts communicate correctly. Our designers and system integrator intellects have spent good time to fix this complex erroneous task. We have developed the capability for embedded architecture co-synthesis and system integration problem based on an orchestrated combination of architectural strategies, parameterized libraries, and software CAD tools.

					Most embedded systems also involve an operating system, application software and extra interface equipment. The construction of these additional layers are even more complex than the design of the computer's hardware itself. In many cases it is more cost effective to complete your embedded system by leveraging our knowledge of our products instead of hiring and maintaining your own engineering department. We offer more than just commercial off the shelf hardware at great prices. Our team of hardware and software integrators has the expertise to assist you in integrating our services into your own because we create embedded systems every day.
