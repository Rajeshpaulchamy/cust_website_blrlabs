					<h3>Business Imperatives</h3>
					<p>
						The presence of devices in an automobile that connect the devices to other devices within the car and or devices, networks and services outside the car including other cars, home, office or infrastructure.
					</p>
					<p>
						“Connected car” technologies shows innovation racing ahead as auto makers unveil new digital services and autonomous driving features. Both premium and volume auto makers clearly see connected car technologies as essential to their futures.
					</p>
					<p>
						Over the next five years, the connected car could disrupt the entire automotive ecosystem. The industry will undergo fundamental change as semi-autonomous driving emerges, followed by an eventual shift to full autonomous driving. Auto makers that have always seen themselves as product suppliers will take on a new identity as providers of mobility services.

					<h3>Values</h3>

					<p>	
						Connected car developments continue to center on seven functional areas:
					</p>

					<p>
						<b><i>Autonomous driving: </i></b>
						Operation of the vehicle without a human driver at the controls, existing only on a partial basis. Examples include self-parking cars, motorway assistance, and the transportation of goods by trucks on well-delineated routes
					</p>

					<p>
						<b><i>Safety: </i></b>
						The ability to warn the driver of road problems and automatically sense and prevent potential collisions. Examples include danger warning signals and emergency call functions.
					</p>

					<p>
						<b><i>Entertainment: </i></b>
						Functions that provide music and video to passengers and the driver. Examples include smartphone interfaces, Wi-Fi or Local Area Network hotspots, access to social networks, and the “mobile office.”
					</p>

					<p>
						<b><i>Well-being: </i></b>
						Optimization of the driver’s health and competence. Examples include electronic alerts that detect or mitigate fatigue, and other forms of individual assistance
					</p>

					<p>
						<b><i>Vehicle management: </i></b>
						Support for minimizing operating cost and increasing comfort. Examples include remote control of car features, displays of service and vehicle status, and the transmittal of traffic data
					</p>

					<p>
						<b><i>Mobility management: </i></b>
						Guidance on faster, safer, more economical, and more fuel-efficient driving, based on data gathered for the vehicle. Examples include real-time traffic information displays, displays of repair and service-related information, and the transfer of usage data.
					</p>

					<p>
						<b><i>Home integration: </i></b>
						Links to homes, offices, and other buildings. Examples include the integration of the automobile into home alarms or energy monitoring systems.
