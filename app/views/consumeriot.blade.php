					For the last few things, technology has given rise to quite a number of innovations. Today, almost everything is connected to some kind of a network, communicating with each other and to intelligent devices such as smartphones. Simply add sensors to these devices and they will also be able to act more intelligently. In essence, this will create a smarter planet where energy efficiency is greater, appliances are smarter, and the overall life is better. This interconnection of things using smart sensors and embedded technologies is known as internet of things (IoT). Today the world is perceiving an advent of a large number of internet of things service providers.

					Consumer electronics is a key area in the Internet of Things (IoT) and continues to gain traction everyday. These IoT based smart-home gadgets are expected to take off. One in every five U.S. homes with broadband access will buy at least one smart-home device within a year, pushing sales of these devices from 20.7 million in 2014 to 35.9 by 2016, according to a survey released in October by the Consumer Electronics Association. Half of the surveyed buyers were under 35 years old.
